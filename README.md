```
### Question 2
How many files are suspected of containing malware?
Format: int
#### Step 1
Click Follow > TCP Stream from the previous way. There are q.exe, w.exe, e.exe, r.exe, t.exe. 
![assets/s16q2.jpg](assets/s16q2.jpg)
#### Answer
```c
5
```
### Question 3
What is the hash of the first file (q.exe)?
Format: sha256
#### Step 1
![assets/s16q2.jpg](assets/s16q2.jpg)
If we look at the "Follow TCP Stream", it shows like this

PASV

227 Entering Passive Mode (216,55,163,106,199,145)
227 Entering Passive Mode (h1,h2,h3,h4,p1,p2)
h1,h2,h3,h4 = IP address of the server
p1,p2 = two bytes that form the TCP port
#### Step 2
Calculate the port for filtering, by the formula
```
port = (p1*256) + p2
```
which means (for q3)
port = (199*256)+145 = 51089
#### Step 3
Do filtering with:
```c
ip.addr == 216.55.163.106 && tcp.port == 51089
```
#### Step 4
Follow > TCP Stream > Save as raw, name it q.exe
#### Step 5
Do hash sha256, with the command:
```c
sha256 q.exe
```
#### Answer
